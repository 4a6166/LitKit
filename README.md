Litkit was developed and made available through my old company, Prelimine.
This repo is a fork from my old business account as the [business](https://www.prelimine.com) was sunset.

This repo is being made public as 
[source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software).
This repo may be viewed for reference but no legal rights to use, 
share, or modify it or any part of it are granted without explicit authorization.
If you want to request that explicit authorization, feel free to [email me](mailto:jacob.field@gmail.com).
